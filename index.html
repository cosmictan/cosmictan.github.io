      Imagine being a detective in a foggy city, trying to piece together a case where every clue is hidden behind dusty windows. You’d need more than one tool to see what’s really going on. My research does exactly this, but on a cosmic scale, using galaxies as the crime scenes and advanced instruments as the detective kit.
   </p>

    <p>
      I study galaxies detected at radio wavelengths, which are like a camera that can see straight through thick cosmic dust. By combining radio, optical, and infrared data, I show that radio-selected galaxies are significantly more dust-obscured than those found with optical surveys. Even more intriguingly, the galaxies we miss are the least obscured and typically the lowest-mass ones. This hints that the mass distribution of newly formed stars may differ between low and high mass galaxies, adding an extra twist to the story of galaxy evolution.

To sharpen our view, I’ve also worked on improving galaxy star-formation rate measurements using radio emission and H-alpha light. By linking multiple dust tracers, I developed a new way to probe dust geometry in galaxies. Think of it as switching between different flashlight filters to reveal hidden fingerprints on a grimy window, suddenly, the clues become much clearer, and so does our interpretation of galaxy light.

      These scientific results expose a major technical challenge. Today’s most powerful instruments can observe ~5,000 objects at once using robotic positioners, but the next generation of surveys is aiming for 20,000+ simultaneous targets. That’s like a detective needing a toolkit that can not only see through smoke and fog, but also investigate thousands of city blocks at the same time.

To tackle this, I work on the design and specification of future multi-object spectroscopy instruments. I’ve built a proof-of-concept code to model how next-generation positioner systems could operate, helping us understand how to efficiently allocate observational resources and push instrument capabilities to their limits.
  </p>

    <p>
      My research journey connects the science and the engineering: from uncovering biases in how we observe dusty galaxies, to proposing technical solutions that will enable larger, cleaner, and more representative galaxy samples. Together, these efforts are helping us build the tools we need to uncover the universe’s best-hidden secrets.
